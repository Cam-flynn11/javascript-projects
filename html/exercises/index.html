    <p>
      I want to create a website or app that people can publicly rate landlords.
      There will be restrictions on the things that can be said, but the overall
      goal is to help tenants find landlords that will meet their needs. From
      personal experience, tenants needs are overlooked more times than not and
      I feel it is not fair to tenants to have a record of renting, but not the
      landlords.
